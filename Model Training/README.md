# Model training
This directory contains the scripts to train our image classification models on the combined dataset ([30VNFoods](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quandang/vietnamese-foods) with our [Vietnamese food images dataset crawled on Google Images and ShopeeFood](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hoangviettung/custom-food-dataset)).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. You'll also need to install the required packages. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can also try out these scripts on your own Kaggle notebook.
### About training procedure
The training process of all the scripts were executed on [Kaggle](kaggle.com), where we could use free GPUs to train our image classification models with no cost, which helped a lot during the process of making this project!
